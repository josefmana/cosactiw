# Assumptions

The analysis consists of a set of GLMs (logistic for binary variables, least squares Gaussian regressions for continuous variables) with adjustment sets derived from causal assumptions depicted in the following DAG:

```{r}
#| label: fig-dag
#| fig-cap: "Directed acyclic graph (DAG) depicting causal assumptions about relations of variables under investigation. The 'S' node represents the **s**election process that is automatically conditioned on in the sapmle (which is being indicated by a square)."

tar_read(dag_plot)

```


# Analysis & Summary of Results

Estimates comprise of a set of marginalised means and their comparisons from GLMs regressing the outcome on the exposure and adjustement set derived from @fig-dag. Interactions of the exposure and all adjustement set variable were included whereas interactions between adjustment sets' variables were not included. The results are presented for midlife-PA as the exposure and several different (types of) outcomes:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-adj
#| tbl-cap: "Adjusted estimates of the effect of midlife physical activity (m-PA) on cognitive, affective, and physical outcomes of interest. Under the hypothesis presented in @fig-dag, these estimates represent unbiased estimates of total causal effect in the current sample."

tar_read(results)$adjusted$mPA |>
  mutate( Variable = if_else(Variable == "cPA", "Physical Activity", Variable) ) |>
  apa()

```

These can be contrasted against estimates of otherwise equivalent GLMs with no covariates (i.e., unadjusted estimates of association between exposure and outcome):

```{r}
#| label: tbl-unadj
#| tbl-cap: "Unadjusted estimates of the effect of midlife physical activity (m-PA) on cognitive, affective, and physical outcomes of interest. Under the hypothesis presented in @fig-dag, these estimates are biased estimates of total causal effect due to confounding by common causes."

tar_read(results)$unadjusted$mPA |>
  mutate( Variable = if_else(Variable == "cPA", "Physical Activity", Variable) ) |>
  apa()
