### [Midlife physical activity effects on mental health in advanced age](/docs/comparisons/index.html)

A study examining the effect of midlife physical activity (operationalised as membership to a sample of lifelong physically active/COSACTIW or general population/NANOK women) and indexes of mental health in elderly ladies. A set of generalised linear models with adjustment sets derived from causal assumptions represented by a directed acyclic graph imply that high level of midlife physical activity in our sample causes lower anxiety (assessed by GAI) and depressive symptoms (assessed by GDS-15), and higher functional independence (assessed by FAQ) compared to an average level of midlife physical activity. We did not detect a statistically clear effect of midlife physical activity on composite cognitive Z-score or SuperAging.
