# This is a script running targets pipeline of the COSACTIW vs NANOK comparisons project.

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)

# Set target options:

  "here",        # for path listing
  "tidyverse",   # for data wrangling
  "openxlsx",    # for data reading
  "effsize",     # for effect sizes
  "rcompanion",  # for computation of some effect sizes
  "brms",        # for Bayesian regressions
  "bayesplot"    # for plotting

# Use multiple cores for Bayesian models fitting:
