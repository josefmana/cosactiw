### Leisure activities

Self-reported leisure activities' distributions were described in three ways: (i) as counts of activity type per participant, (ii) as a number of participants reporting at least one activity of each activity type, and (iii) as a time-series of expected means of self-reported intensity ratings.

Counts of activity type were described by their in-sample means $\pm$ standard deviations separately for SA and non-SA groups stratified by modality (physical, mental, both). Null hypotheses of equal means and stochastical uniformity of SA versus non-SA activity type counts distributions were tested via *t*-test with Welch modification to the degrees of freedom and Mann-Whitney U test respectively. Effect sizes of differences between SA and non-SA means and distributions were described by Cohen's d and Vargha and Delaney A (VD.A) as implemented in the "effsize" R package [@effsize; @vargha2000]. Furthermore, a set of linear regressions with each activity type as the outcome and additive effect of SA status, age in years and education level was fitted to explore difference in counts between SA and non-SA participants of comparable age and education level. Decision threshold for rejecting a null hypothesis was set at p < .05.

The number of participants reporting at least one activity belonging to a given activity type was described by contingency tables of activity typs (rows) and SA status (SA, non-SA, columns) separately for each modality (physical, mental). Within each modality, Pearson's $\chi^2$ test of the null hypothesis that SA status and activity type are independent of each other was performed. The strength of association between SA status and activity type was described by Cramérs' V as implemented in the "rcompanion" package [@rcompanion]. Decision threshold for rejecting a null hypothesis was set at p < .05.

Finally, the expected means of self-reported intensities of single leisure activities across lifetime were modelled by a Bayesian Generalised Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with time (half-decades of adult life) as a monotonic predictor [@bürkner2017b; @bürkner2020]. In the model, self-reported intensity of leisure activities was regressed on the half-decade of life (monotonic ordered predictor), SA status, modality, and their two- and three-way interactions on group-level as well as correlated participant- and activity type-specific intercepts and slopes across half-decades. The GLMM was fitted to data and used to generate posterior draws of the expected value of the activity intensity conditional on different combinations of half-decade of life, SA status and modality as predictors of interest. These posterior draws were then described by their medians and 95% equal tailed posterior intervals (ETIs). Moreover, pairwise comparisons between expected intensity conditional on half-decades of life, SA status and modality were directly compared and evaluated by the probability of direction (*pd*) index [@makowski2019]^[The *pd* is a so called index of effect existence quantifying the certainty associated with the most probable direction of a posterior distribution. Following guidelines of @makowski2019 it can be interpreted as a continuous index whereby *pd* ≥ 95% indicates uncertain association, *pd* > 95% indicates possibly existing association, *pd* > 97% indicates likely existing association, *pd* > 99% indicates probably existing association, and *pd* > 99.9% indicates almost certainly existing association.]. All pairwise comparisons estimates are denoted as $\delta_{x-y}$ throughout the article.

The GLMM was fitted using Stan’s (version `r stan_version()`) build-in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler accessed via R version `r with( version, paste(major,minor,sep=".") )` using package “brms” [@bürkner2017; @rsoft; @stan]. Four parallel chains were run each for 2,000 iterations for each GLMM. The first 1,000 iterations served as a warm-up and were discarded. Convergence was checked numerically by inspection of the $\hat{R}s$ and visually by inspection of trace plots. Posterior predictive checks for each combination of primary predictors was used to check whether the models reliably reproduce in-sample means and standard deviations. This study’s design and its analysis were not pre-registered. The data are not publicly available due to privacy or ethical restrictions. The computer code used in the data analysis can be accessed at [https://github.com/josefmana/cosactiw.git](https://github.com/josefmana/cosactiw.git).

# Results

```{r}
#| label: data-read

tar_load(N) # number of SA/nonSA ladies

demo      <- tar_read(demography_comparisons)   # age, education info
la_counts <- tar_read(counts_comparisons_table) # table with activity counts
la_regres <- tar_read(counts_regressions_table) # table with regression for counts results

tar_load(chisquares)   # Chi-square test results
tar_load(cross_tables) # contingency tables

exp <- tar_read(posterior_expectations) # conditional expectations of the intensities GLMM
pwc <- tar_read(posterior_contrasts)    # pairwise comparisons of the intensities GLMM

```

Overall, there was `r N['SA']` women categorised as SA (`r demo['Age_years', 'SA']` years old, `r demo['Education_years', 'SA']` years of education), and `r N['nonSA']` women categorised as non-SA (`r demo['Age_years', 'nonSA']` years old, `r demo['Education_years', 'nonSA']` years of education) in the sample. The null hypothesis of equal means was not rejected for either age (*t*(`r demo['Age_years', 'df']`) = `r demo['Age_years', 't']`, p = `r demo['Age_years', 'p']`) or education (*t*(`r demo['Education_years', 'df']`) = `r demo['Education_years', 't']`, p = `r demo['Education_years', 'p']`).

### Counts of activity types

```{r}
#| label: regression-res

# re-code regression result of interest such that it is SA-minus-nonSA
beta <- sub(
  
  pattern     = "-",
  replacement = "",
  x           = with(la_regres, get('b_safnon-Superager')[category == 'flexibility_health_exercise'])
  
)

# 95% CI
beta_CI <-
  sub( "-", "", with(la_regres, `CI_safnon-Superager`[category == "flexibility_health_exercise"]) ) %>%
  strsplit(",", fixed = T) %>%
  unlist()

beta_CI <- paste0("[", sub( "-", "", sub("]", "", beta_CI[2], fixed = T) ),", ", sub("[", "", beta_CI[1], fixed = T),"]")

```

Counts of activities per participant in SA and non-SA group and their comparison are presented in @tbl-la-counts. No tested null hypothesis was rejected. The only notable pattern was relatively higher number of self-reported activities from the "flexibility and health exercise" category by SA (`r with(la_counts, SA[category == 'flexibility_health_exercise'])`) compared to non-SA (`r with(la_counts, nonSA[category == 'flexibility_health_exercise'])`) participants (*t*(`r with(la_counts, df[category == 'flexibility_health_exercise'])`) = `r with(la_counts, t_stat[category == 'flexibility_health_exercise'])`, d = `r with(la_counts, cohens_d[category == 'flexibility_health_exercise'])`). Similar results were observed in the regression analyses whereby after adjusting for age and education, SA participants were expected to report `r beta` (95% CI `r beta_CI`) activities more than non-SA participants (see @tbl-la-regres).

### Number of participants reporting an activity

The overall distribution of the number of participants engaging in at least one activity from each activity type is presented in @tbl-la-nums. Based on the data, the null hypothesis of activity type and SA status independence was not rejected for either physical ($\chi^2$(`r chisquares['physical', 'df']`) = `r chisquares['physical', 'chisq']`, p = `chisquares['physical', 'p']`, Cramér's V = `r chisquares['physical', 'cramer_v']`) or mental ($\chi^2$(`r chisquares['mental', 'df']`) = `r chisquares['mental', 'chisq']`, p = `r chisquares['mental', 'p']`, Cramér's V = `r chisquares['mental', 'cramer_v']`) activities.

```{r}

cross_tables %>%
  
  select( -ends_with("SA") ) %>%
  relocate(nonSA_perc, .before = SA_perc) %>%
  mutate( Type = capitalise(Type) ) %>%
  
  gt_apa(grp = "Type") %>%
  cols_align(columns = -c(1:2), align = "center") %>%
  cols_label(
    Category ~ "Activity type",
    SA_perc ~ "SA",

### Intensity ratings

```{r}
#| label: glmms

fit <- tar_read(intensities_loglinear_regressions)$ordered_time

# extract rhats
rhatmax <- ubound( max( brms::rhat(fit) ), 3)

```

The GLMM converged in the specified number of iterations to a stationary posterior distribution ($\hat{R}s \leq `r rhatmax`$) and showed adequate reproduction of sample means (@fig-ppc-mean) and standard deviations (@fig-ppc-sd) but not the shapes of sample distributions (@fig-ppc-dens). Consequently, the model likely well represents conditional expectations but it does not reliably predict responses.

Posterior expected intensity ratings predicted by the model are summarised in @fig-cond-means. According to the model and data, self-reported intensity of physical activities decreases with age whereas self-reported intensity of mental activities increases with age (left panel of @fig-cond-means). These modality-dependent opposing tendencies seem to be invariant to the SA status (right panel of @fig-cond-means). Pairwise comparisons of expected intensity rating between life half-decades conditional on SA status and activity modality are presented in @tbl-pair-comps. The model predicts that average intensity ratings of physical activities decrease between 85 and 30 years of age by `r sub( '-', '', sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'physical' & SA == 'SA')$Estimate_logexp) )` points in SA (95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'physical' & SA == 'SA')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'physical' & SA == 'nonSA')$pd_logexp`) and by `r sub( '-', '', sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'physical' & SA == 'nonSA')$Estimate_logexp) )` points in non-SA (95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'physical' & SA == 'nonSA')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'physical' & SA == 'nonSA')$pd_logexp`) participants. On the other, it predicts that average intensity ratings of mental activities increase between 85 and 30 years of age by `r sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'mental' & SA == 'SA')$Estimate_logexp)` points in SA (95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'mental' & SA == 'SA')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$pd_logexp`) and by `r sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$Estimate_logexp)` points in non-SA (95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & actype == 'mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$pd_logexp`) participants. According to the model, the difference between these trends in mental and physical activity ratings evolution is non-zero with high posterior probability on the level of almost certainly existing association in both SA ($\delta_{physical-mental}$ = `r sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'physical - mental' & SA == 'SA')$Estimate_logexp)`, 95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'physical - mental' & SA == 'SA')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'physical - mental' & SA == 'SA')$pd_logexp`) and non-SA ($\delta_{physical-mental}$ = `r sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'physical - mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$Estimate_logexp)`, 95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'physical - mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'physical - mental' & SA == 'nonSA')$pd_logexp`) participants. On the other hand, these trends do not significantly differ between SA and non-SA participants in either mental ($\delta_{SA-nonSA}$ = `r sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'SA - nonSA' & actype == 'mental')$Estimate_logexp)`, 95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'SA - nonSA' & actype == 'mental')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'SA - nonSA' & actype == 'mental')$pd_logexp`) or physical ($\delta_{SA-nonSA}$ = `r sub(' .*', '', subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'SA - nonSA' & actype == 'physical')$Estimate_logexp)`, 95% ETI `r paste( strsplit(subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'SA - nonSA' & actype == 'physical')$Estimate_logexp, ' ')[[1]][2:3], collapse = ' ')`, *pd* = `r subset(pwc, diff == '85 - 30' & diff2 == 'SA - nonSA' & actype == 'physical')$pd_logexp`) activities.
